            <p> <i> Our patients were without question seriously ill. This reflects the selection of more serious,
                    life-threatening attempts for admission to the intensive care unit.ICU is one of the most critically
                    functioning operational environments in a hospital.
                    Every ICU in a hospital has a different environment that will reflect the specialist medical and
                    surgical procedures they perform.
                    Most ICUs are fairly large sterile areas with a high concentration of specialised, technical and
                    monitoring equipment needed to care for critically ill patients.
                    The ICU environment can be confronting for some patients and visitors who may find the activity,
                    sounds, machines, tubes and monitors intimidating.
                    When you visit someone you care about in ICU it can be an uncomfortable experience - you may feel
                    helpless, overwhelmed, frustrated and sad. Your feelings and apprehension are understood by the
                    staff that provide support for the people you care about.
                    Typically ICU also has a higher ratio of doctors and nurses to patients.</i></p>

                <img src="images/facility images/Hospital Rooms.jpg" alt="">
            </center>
            <p> <i> Although hospital is very high risk for nosocomial infection (hospital-acquired infection),
                    everything in hospital have to show a hygiene and comfortable space for patients and their family
                    and also for paramedics.
                    For patient room, I say as VIP room. Dominated by a bed. Usually has a bedside table, comfortable
                    chair and one or more dining type chairs. Decorated in colors designed to be restful but come off as
                    akin to a decorators choices for a funeral home. Cold, institutional tile floor. Window that looks
                    out on beautiful landscape. Private bath that conceal its functionality. Handicap railing on toilet,
                    shower and tub. Entry to both hospital room and private bath is a large heavy door engineered to
                    open quietly and won't slam. Bed somewhat lumpy with padding and sheets that are trying to mask the
                    thick plastic covering the mattress. Sheets in sterile white with pale blue blanket. Phone attached
                    to the bed with a cord. Call button also attached to the bed. </i></p>

            </center>
            <p> <i> An ambulance is a medically equipped vehicle which transports patients to treatment facilities, such
                    as hospitals.[1] Typically, out-of-hospital medical care is provided to the patient during the
                    transport.
                    Ambulances are used to respond to medical emergencies by emergency medical services (EMS)Generally,
                    vehicles count as an ambulance if they can transport patients. However, it varies by jurisdiction as
                    to whether a non-emergency patient transport vehicle (also called an ambulette) is counted as an
                    ambulance.

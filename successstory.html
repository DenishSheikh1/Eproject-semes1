        <h2>A Glimmer of Hope</h2>
        <p class="aboutContent1">
          Muskan was lighting a matchstick when she mistakenly dropped it on
          her clothes causing them to catch fire and burning her entire body.
          Her family immediately took her to a hospital in Jamshoro, where
          they were told that her condition is such that she would not survive
          for long. After receiving this news, her family was devastated but
          they were not willing to give up hope. Her frightened family then
          brought her to Patel Hospital where she arrived in the Emergency
          Unit in a very critical condition and needed immediate admission to
          Burns ICU. This incident took place when COVID-19 was at its peak
          and severe SOPs were in place. This meant admitting patients with a
          traveling history was risky and difficult. The staff members had to
          take extra precautions while attending Muskan. Her wound was deeply
          infected and she was under life threatening sepsis. Her parents were
          also extremely worried so it was imperative that they be counseled
          and motivated so they could further support her during this intense
          journey. </p>

        <p id="aboutcontentmore1" style="display: none;">
          The first objective was to get her in a stable condition,
          which is why she was kept on fluids and antibiotics, and her
          dressing was changed regularly. Once her condition stabilized, she
          was taken for surgery. Our Plastic Surgery team and ICU team worked
          collaboratively with the ID team to breathe a new life into Muskan.
          After our staff's rigorous efforts, Muskan was finally brought out
          of sepsis, and Skin Grafting for her deep wound was done by the
          Plastic Surgery team. This process was very long and painful for
          Muskan and her family. Even our healthcare staff went through a
          tough time when dealing with such a fragile situation. Hence, they
          provided her extra care so that her recovery gets easier, and her
          family extra support so they can courageously deal with her
          situation. Wounds heal over time but scars remain forever. Certain
          actions change lives in seconds and the struggle is consistent after
          that. Take care of your family and keep risky objects away from
          them.

        <h2>WELFARE IN HEALTHCARE</h2>
        <p class="aboutContent2">
          A middle-aged man, Mr. Ilyas, visited Patel Hospital's ENT
          department with abnormal cheek growth and ulcer. He had been
          experiencing unnatural growth for the past 3 months that started to
          protrude out of his cheek. At which point he decided that this could
          not be ignored and needed immediate professional attention. Upon his
          arrival, an in-depth analysis was conducted by our healthcare panel
          during which it was discovered that he used to be an active consumer
          of paan, betel nuts, and tobacco. Even though he discontinued these
          habits approximately 8 years ago, unfortunately, the damage from the
          excessive usage had already been done. After further investigations
          by our panel of expert Oncologists and Surgeons, it was concluded
          that he needs to be operated. Our panel of professionals had several
          meetings and discussions with Mr. Ilyas and his family to make them
          understand the complications of biopsy and its possible outcomes
          before proceeding with the surgery. The family and the patient
          gathered all information about his issue after which they took an
          informed decision and gave approval for the surgery. Mr. Ilyas
          belonged to a low-income family.</p>

        <p id="aboutcontentmore2" style="display: none;">
          His family had very limited means
          due to which they were unable to afford the expenses of the surgery.
          So, Patel Hospital, being a philanthropist organization, decided to
          relieve them of their financial burden by funding the entire
          treatment process. Our experienced team of trained and skilled staff
          performed the surgery for the removal of the tumor on his cheek,
          clearance of neck nodes, and reconstruction of the defect. The
          recovery process post-operation was extremely challenging for Mr.
          Ilyas. His diet had been compromised as it became very difficult for
          him to chew and swallow his food. He couldn', even eat his favorite
          food and had to give it up because of his ulcer. However, with the
          strong support of Patel Hospital and its extremely caring staff, he
          went on to make a stable recovery post the operation and proceeds to
          live a happy and healthy life. With the increasing consumption of
          tobacco in Pakistan, many issues related to it are at a high.
          Addictive substances have broken down lives and torn families apart.
          Do yourself a favour and those around you and stop its consumption.

        <h2>PRESERVING ANOTHER SMILE </h2>
        <p class="aboutContent3">
          Teenagers are usually energetic and spirited, leading a life without any care in the world. However,
          Shaheena's life was nothing like that. Once a lively 15-year-old girl, she had become bedridden after a
          serious infection in her brain.
          She was admitted to the ICU of a local hospital with high-grade fever and extremely low consciousness. During
          her diagnosis, management detected a brain infection which was later confirmed by her brain fluid report (CSF
          analysis).
          Initially, her brain was quite responsive to the therapy being provided, hence she was moved out of the ICU to
          the general ward. Her condition remained stable for two days, after which her level of consciousness started
          declining again and she started feeling lethargic.
          Urgent brain imaging was run on her which revealed an increasing brain pressure. The neurosurgeon on call
          placed a drain (EVD) in her brain system to temporarily relieve the pressure. He further planned on installing
          a VP shunt for more permanent control of her brain pressure once her infection was settled. Her condition
          gradually stabilized, especially after receiving injectable antibiotics.</p>

        <p id="aboutcontentmore3" style="display: none;">

          She remained in the hospital for another two weeks. This prolonged stay of hers was putting her family into a
          grave financial crisis. Therefore, they decided to take Shaheena to a public hospital where her treatment can
          be conducted much more economically. However, despite visiting three government hospitals, her family didn't
          receive any positive response.
          At which point Mr. Raheem, Shaheena's father, suggested taking her to Patel Hospital.
          She was admitted the very same day and her treatment started soon after. Within a few days, her condition
          seemed to improve, and after clearance from the infection disease department, a VP shunt was placed through
          her brain system (ventricle).
          Three days after the final procedure, there was a noticeable improvement in her state after which she was
          discharged from the hospital. With her parents' support, she walked her way out of the hospital with strength
          and vigor.
          Children are the light of everyone's lives. Their smiles are cherished by their parents and that is the aim of
          Patel Hospital. Early detection and diagnosis saves lives and keeps families together.

        <h2>CONVERSATIONS OF THE HEART</h2>
        <p class="aboutContent4">
          On a regular workday, Mr. Ateeq experienced severe chest pain, predominantly in the center. Initially, he
          assumed it to be reflux of acidity kicking in but after an hour of immense pain, he decided to go to a
          hospital for professional help.
          Trusting the competence of Patel Hospital and their services, Mr. Ateeq arrived at the hospital after much
          struggle. He was admitted to the emergency room and evaluated for his symptoms. After the initial assessment
          was complete, his blood pressure was 90/60, heart rate was 120 beats per minute and oxygen saturation was 91%.
          After some further examination, an ECG was conducted and the results concluded that he was suffering from
          Myocardial Infarction, commonly known as “MI” - Major Heart Attack.
          After the ECG, minor medication was given to Mr. Ateeq and further information regarding his condition and
          treatment was shared with his family. </p>

        <p id="aboutcontentmore4" style="display: none;">

          Mr. Ateeq was advised to go for “Primary Angioplasty”. This procedure restores the blood flow in the occluded
          artery to bring back the blood flow and resume the proper functioning of the heart.
          Mr. Ateeq was shifted to Coronary Catheterization Laboratory where he underwent surgery on his occluded artery
          called LAD i.e., Left Anterior Descending artery which would restore the blood flow. During the procedure, he
          developed (Ventricular Fibrillation), a heartbeat that if not treated within 10 seconds may result in death.
          This condition was treated with Electrical Cardio Version (shock). After some critical hours, Mr. Ateeq
          reverted to his normal heartbeat and regained consciousness.
          He remained in the critical care unit for monitoring and stabilization after the shock treatment. Two days
          later, he was discharged. Over time he progressed towards a healthy life by quitting smoking, exercising
          regularly, and following a healthy diet.
          Mr. Ateeq's heart condition has improved over time and he is in the process of recovering. He continues to
          visit the hospital for on-going support and care.
          A healthy heart is a blessing from God. Listen to what your heart is telling you before it is too late. Do
          your part for your heart because all it takes is a little effort.
